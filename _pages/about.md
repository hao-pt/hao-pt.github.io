<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Greetings! I am a first year PhD student in Computer Science at Cornell Tech, NYC. Previously, I was an AI Research Resident at <a href="https://www.vinai.io/">VinAI</a>, where I was fortunate to work under the mentorship of Dr. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FYZ5ODQAAAAJ&hl=en/">Anh Tran</a>. Before that, I received my Bachelor of Computer Science from <a href="https://www.hcmus.edu.vn/">Ho Chi Minh City University of Science</a> (HCMUS) in Vietnam.

My primary research interests focus on generative models, with a particular emphasis on diffusion models.
