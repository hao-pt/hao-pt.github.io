<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Greetings! It is a great pleasure to welcome you here. I am an AI Research Resident at <a href="https://www.vinai.io/">VinAI</a>, a renowned AI research company in Vietnam, where I have the privilege of working under the mentorship of Dr. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/anhttranusc/">Anh Tran</a>. Before that, I received my Bachelor of Computer Science from <a href="https://www.hcmus.edu.vn/">Ho Chi Minh City University of Science</a> (HCMUS) in Vietnam.

<!-- He earned an outstanding thesis award under the supervision of Dr. Ngoc Quoc Ly - the Head of the Department of Computer Vision and Cognitive Cybernetics at HCMUS.  -->

My primary research interests lie in the field of Computer Vision, with a specific focus on deep generative models.
Currently, I am actively engaged in improving the efficiency and controllability of diffusion models, particularly in their application to conditional image generation.
